# Nexford_Highridge-Construction-Company-Payment-Slips

# Objective: 
To develop a Python program to facilitate the weekly payments of workers.

# Expectations: 
1. Use variables to create a list of workers dynamically (at least 400 workers).  
2. Utilize a for loop to generate payment slips for each of the 400 workers.  
3. Implement the following conditional statements within the for loop:
   - If the salary is greater than $10,000 and less than $20,000, assign the Employee level as "A1."
   - If the salary is greater than $7,500 and less than $30,000 and the employee is female, set the Employee level as "A5-F."  
4. Add exception handling to your Python code to address potential errors.  
5. Convert your Python code into R.

# Required python modules:
Install and import the following python modiles
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ Names

# Running the codes:
Run codes using Jupyter lab or Jupyter note book as IDE  
Change kernel to python 3 while running python code and to R while running R code.
